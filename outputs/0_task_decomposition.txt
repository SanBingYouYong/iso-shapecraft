components:
  - name: Backrest Base
    description: A tall, rectangular prism that extends vertically from the rear edge of the chair seat. It should have a height greater than that of the seat and a width that matches or slightly exceeds the width of the seat for stability. The edges should be rounded to create a softer aesthetic, and the base should be slightly thicker at the bottom for structural integrity.

  - name: Inclined Backrest Surface
    description: A slanted surface that forms the main ergonomic area of the backrest. This surface should have an angle of inclination that promotes comfort and support, typically around 10 to 15 degrees from vertical. The top edge should have a smooth curve that transitions into the rounded edges of the backrest base, ensuring a cohesive look that complements the seat.

  - name: Rounded Edge Trims
    description: These are thin, rounded strips that run along the edges of both the backrest base and the inclined backrest surface. They should be seamlessly integrated into the design to soften the overall appearance. The trims should be uniform in thickness, providing a consistent outline that enhances the ergonomic shape while maintaining a modern aesthetic.
