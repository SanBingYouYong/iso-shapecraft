To combine the sub-components into the intended upright, rectangular backrest shape for the chair, follow these high-level instructions:

1. **Position the Backrest Base**: Start by placing the Backrest Base vertically at the rear edge of the chair seat. Ensure that the bottom of the base aligns flush with the rear edge of the seat, and verify that the height of the base exceeds that of the seat for proper ergonomic support. The width of the base should match or slightly exceed the seat width for stability.

2. **Attach the Inclined Backrest Surface**: Position the Inclined Backrest Surface on the top portion of the Backrest Base, angling it at approximately 10 to 15 degrees from vertical. The bottom edge of the inclined surface should connect seamlessly to the top edge of the Backrest Base. Ensure that the top edge of the inclined surface has a smooth curve that transitions into the rounded edges of the Backrest Base, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics.

3. **Integrate Rounded Edge Trims**: Finally, apply the Rounded Edge Trims along the edges of both the Backrest Base and the Inclined Backrest Surface. These trims should be placed uniformly to wrap around the rounded edges, ensuring a seamless integration into the overall design. The trims will soften the appearance of the backrest while maintaining a cohesive look that complements the chair seat.

By following these steps, you will create a backrest that is both functional and visually appealing, providing the desired ergonomic support.
