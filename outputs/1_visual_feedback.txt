- **Consistency:** No  
- **Issues:** The shape is not fully upright; it appears to have a slight lean. Additionally, while the edges are rounded, the front view shows that the incline for ergonomic support is not clearly defined. The overall dimensions may not convincingly express that it¡¯s taller than the seat.  
- **Suggestions:** Adjust the orientation of the shape to ensure it stands upright relative to the seat. Increase its height to emphasize that it is taller than the seat. Introduce a more pronounced ergonomic incline by modifying the back edge¡¯s profile, ensuring it seamlessly connects and supports the chair seat. Consider verifying the angle and curvature of the rounded edges to achieve a more natural and ergonomic appearance.
