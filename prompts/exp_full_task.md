# Shape Program Generation Instruction

**Objective:** Generate a code snippet in the target programming language to produce the 3D shape described. The generated code should:
1. Align with the shape description.
2. Be syntactically correct, functional, can be executed stand-alone or be called as a method. 
3. Focus on the current shape, ignore other unrelated descriptions.

**Output Format:** 
[code snippet (provide code only)]

Use the following code structure:
```python
import bpy  # add other modules as needed

def your_function(any parameters):
    your code

your_function(any parameters)
