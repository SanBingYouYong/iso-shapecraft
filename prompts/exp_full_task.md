**Objective:** Given the user prompt describing a 3D shape, enerate a code snippet in the target programming language to produce the shape described. The generated code should:
1. Align with the component description.
2. Be syntactically correct, functional, can be executed stand-alone or be called as a method. 
3. Produce a 3D representation consistent with the intended design.

**Output Format:** 
[code snippet (provide code only)]

Use the following code structure:
```python
import bpy

def your_function(<any parameters>):
    <your code>

your_function(<parameters>)
