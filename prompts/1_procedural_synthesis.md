# Shape Synthesis Instruction

**Objective:** Generate a code snippet in the target programming language that can function as a procedural method to produce the 3D shape described. The generated code should:
1. Align with the shape description.
2. Be syntactically correct, functional, can be executed stand-alone or be called as a method. 
3. Focus on the current shape, ignore other unrelated descriptions.
4. As a procedural method, expose necessary parameters to control the shape, and must include: position, orientation, and scale.

**Output Format:** 
[code snippet (provide code only)]
