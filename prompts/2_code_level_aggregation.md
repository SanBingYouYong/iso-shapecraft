# Code-Level Aggregation Instruction

**Objective**: Based on high level aggregation instructions, integrate the provided code snippets into a complete, functional shape program. The final program should:
1. Ensure syntactical correctness and compatibility between snippets.
2. Optimize the logic for seamless integration of components.
3. Produce a 3D model that matches the overall shape description when executed.

**Output Format**:
[code for the whole shape program (provide code only)]
