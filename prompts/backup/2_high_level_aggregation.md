## High-Level Aggregation Instruction

**User Prompt:** {user_prompt}  
**Sub-task Prompts and Code Snippets:**  
- Sub-task 1: {description and code}  
- Sub-task 2: {description and code}  
- ...

**Objective:** Combine the provided sub-task outputs into an initial aggregated shape program. Ensure:
1. Alignment with the overarching user prompt.
2. Logical cohesion between components.
3. High-level structural correctness.

**Output Format:** 
- Initial Aggregated Program: [aggregated program code]
