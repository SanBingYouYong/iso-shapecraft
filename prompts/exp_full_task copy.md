# Shape Program Generation Instruction

**Objective:** Given the user prompt describing a 3D shape, enerate a code snippet in the target programming language to produce the shape described. The generated code should:
1. Align with the component description.
2. Be syntactically correct, functional, can be executed stand-alone or be called as a method. 
3. Produce a 3D representation consistent with the intended design.
4. If possible, create new mesh with raw coordinates. 

**Output Format:** 
[code snippet (provide code only)]
