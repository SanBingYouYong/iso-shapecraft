It should: \n1. Represent a distinct component or structural element of the 3D model.\n2. Include clear instructions for the synthesis of the component.\n3. Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in covering the user prompt.\n\n**Output Format:** \ncomponents:\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - ...\n\n# User Prompt\nAn upright, rectangular shape that connects to the rear of the chair seat. It should be taller than the seat and have a slight incline for ergonomic support. The edges can be rounded to match the style of the seat."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "components:\n  - name: Backrest\n    description: A tall, rectangular panel that is slightly inclined backward for ergonomic support. The height of the backrest should be greater than that of the chair seat. The edges of the backrest should be smoothly rounded to create a cohesive design with the seat.\n  - name: Connecting Bracket\n    description: A narrow, rectangular support structure that connects the bottom of the backrest to the rear of the chair seat. It should have a slight taper towards the base to create a seamless transition between the backrest and the seat, ensuring stability and aesthetic alignment.\n  - name: Base Support\n    description: A horizontal rectangular base that provides stability for the backrest. This component should be slightly wider than the backrest itself and positioned at the level where the backrest meets the seat. The edges can also be rounded to complement the overall design."}]}
