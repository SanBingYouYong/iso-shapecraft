{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "# Task Breakdown Instruction\n\n**Objective:** Given a user prompt on a 3D model generation task, decompose the overall shape into sub-components and describe each sub-component's shape individually. It should: \n1. Represent a distinct component or structural element of the 3D model.\n2. Include clear instructions for the synthesis of the component.\n3. Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in covering the user prompt.\n\n**Output Format:** \ncomponents:\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - ...\n\n# User Prompt\nwhatever"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "components:\n  - name: Base Platform\n    description: A rectangular prism shape that serves as the foundation for the model. It should have a flat top and bottom with dimensions of 10 units in length, 5 units in width, and 1 unit in height, ensuring stability for the entire structure.\n\n  - name: Central Pillar\n    description: A cylindrical shape that rises vertically from the center of the base platform. The cylinder should have a diameter of 1 unit and a height of 4 units, positioned exactly in the center of the base platform to provide support for the upper components.\n\n  - name: Upper Dome\n    description: A hemisphere that sits atop the central pillar, creating an attractive feature above the structure. The hemisphere should have a radius of 2 units, fitting snugly over the top of the central pillar while extending slightly beyond its diameter.\n\n  - name: Side Supports\n    description: Four rectangular prisms that act as structural supports, positioned evenly around the central pillar. Each support should have dimensions of 0.5 units in width, 0.5 units in height, and 2 units in length, extending from the base platform to provide additional stability.\n\n  - name: Decorative Finial\n    description: A small conical shape that sits on top of the upper dome, giving the model a unique aesthetic element. The cone should have a base diameter of 1 unit and a height of 1 unit, tapering to a point at the top, and should be centered perfectly on the dome."}]}
