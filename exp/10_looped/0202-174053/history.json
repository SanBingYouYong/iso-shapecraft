The script needs to be executed in a context where the Blender Python API can interact with the 3D view.\n2. **Execution Method**: Make sure you run the script while in Object Mode, as Blender may throw an error if you're in Edit Mode or another mode.\n3. **Exact Error Message**: If the error still occurs, please copy the exact error message from Blender\u2019s console. This will help identify the issue more specifically.\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps:\n1. **Reset Blender**: Sometimes, starting with a fresh Blender session helps. Open Blender, and then directly use the scripting tab to run the above code.\n2. **Check Blender Version**: Ensure you are using a version of Blender that supports the API calls made in the script.\n3. **Console Output**: Look for any additional logs or errors printed in the console that can provide insight into what might be going wrong.\n\nIf you provide the exact error message, I can further assist you in diagnosing the problem."}]
