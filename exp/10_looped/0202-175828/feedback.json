[{"iteration": 0, "prompt": "# Visual Feedback Instruction\n\n**Objective:** Given a rendered image of a 3D shape, analyze it against the target shape description and provide feedback on:\n1. Specific discrepancies or areas for improvement.\n2. Suggestions for refining the corresponding code snippet.\n3. Consistency between the visual output and the sub-task intent.\n\nNote that the images contain only raw mesh from Blender viewport, so do not comment textures, lighting or any other aspects that are hardly achievable in a raw mesh rendering. Consider it consistent as long as the shape matches the intention. \n\n**Output Format:** (uses yml format only)\nissues: \n  - description: [issue description]\n    suggestion: [suggestion to correct or improve]\n  - ...\nconsistency: [true/false based on the significance of identified issues]\n\n# Shape Description\nA flat, rectangular mouse pad with a textured surface.", "feedback": "```yaml\nissues: \n  - description: The shape appears to be a flat rectangular surface without any visible texture, which is important for a mouse pad. \n    suggestion: Consider adding a subtle bump or pattern to simulate a textured surface.\n  - description: The corners of the mouse pad might be too sharp, which is not typical for most mouse pads that tend to have rounded edges.\n    suggestion: Modify the geometry to create slightly rounded corners for a more realistic appearance.\nconsistency: false\n```"}]
