- description: A tall, rectangular panel that is wider at the top and slightly narrower
    at the base, designed to provide support for the back. The backrest should have
    a slight incline, approximately 10-15 degrees from vertical, to enhance ergonomic
    comfort. The edges of the backrest are to be rounded to create a smooth transition
    and match the style of the chair seat.
  name: Backrest
- description: A rectangular frame that serves as a structural element to connect
    the backrest to the rear of the chair seat. This bracket should be shorter than
    the backrest and have a flat surface that aligns with the rear edge of the seat
    for stability. The corners of the bracket should also be rounded to maintain a
    cohesive design.
  name: Connection Bracket
- description: A solid, rectangular base that anchors the backrest to the chair seat
    and ensures stability. The base should be slightly wider than the bracket and
    have a flat bottom surface to distribute weight evenly. The top edge of the base
    should be rounded to seamlessly integrate with the bottom of the backrest.
