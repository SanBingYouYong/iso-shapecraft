It should: \n1. Represent a distinct component or structural element of the 3D model.\n2. Include clear instructions for the synthesis of the component.\n3. Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in covering the user prompt.\n\n**Output Format:** \ncomponents:\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - ...\n\n# User Prompt\nAn upright, rectangular shape that connects to the rear of the chair seat. It should be taller than the seat and have a slight incline for ergonomic support. The edges can be rounded to match the style of the seat."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "components:\n  - name: Backrest\n    description: A tall, rectangular panel that is wider at the top and slightly narrower at the base, designed to provide support for the back. The backrest should have a slight incline, approximately 10-15 degrees from vertical, to enhance ergonomic comfort. The edges of the backrest are to be rounded to create a smooth transition and match the style of the chair seat.\n  - name: Connection Bracket\n    description: A rectangular frame that serves as a structural element to connect the backrest to the rear of the chair seat. This bracket should be shorter than the backrest and have a flat surface that aligns with the rear edge of the seat for stability. The corners of the bracket should also be rounded to maintain a cohesive design.\n  - name: Support Base\n    description: A solid, rectangular base that anchors the backrest to the chair seat and ensures stability. The base should be slightly wider than the bracket and have a flat bottom surface to distribute weight evenly. The top edge of the base should be rounded to seamlessly integrate with the bottom of the backrest.\n"}]}
