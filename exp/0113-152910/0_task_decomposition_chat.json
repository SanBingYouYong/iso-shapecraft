{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "# Task Breakdown Instruction\n\n**Objective:** Given a user prompt on a 3D model generation task, decompose the overall shape into sub-components and describe each sub-component's shape individually. It should: \n1. Represent a distinct component or structural element of the 3D model.\n2. Include clear instructions for the synthesis of the component.\n3. Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in covering the user prompt.\n\n**Output Format:** \ncomponents:\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - name: [component name]\n    description: [shape description]\n  - ...\n\n# User Prompt\nAn upright, rectangular shape that connects to the rear of the chair seat. It should be taller than the seat and have a slight incline for ergonomic support. The edges can be rounded to match the style of the seat."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "components:\n  - name: Rectangular Backrest\n    description: A tall, upright rectangular prism that serves as the backrest of the chair. The dimensions should be larger than the seat, providing support to the user. The backrest should have a slight inclination, angling backward from the top to the bottom, to enhance ergonomic comfort. The edges of the rectangular prism should be smoothly rounded to create a cohesive style with the seat.\n\n  - name: Rounded Edges\n    description: A set of rounded fillets applied to all four vertical edges of the rectangular backrest. The rounding should be subtle yet pronounced enough to soften the overall appearance of the backrest. The radius of the roundness should be consistent, matching the curvature style of the chair seat, ensuring a seamless transition between the two components.\n\n  - name: Connection Bracket\n    description: A structural element that connects the backrest to the rear of the chair seat. This bracket should have a flat, rectangular shape with a slight taper toward the top to provide a secure attachment point. The bracket should be designed to fit snugly against the backrest and seat, allowing for a stable and sturdy connection. The edges of the bracket can also be rounded to maintain stylistic consistency with the backrest and seat."}]}
