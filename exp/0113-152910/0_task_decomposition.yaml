- description: A tall, upright rectangular prism that serves as the backrest of the
    chair. The dimensions should be larger than the seat, providing support to the
    user. The backrest should have a slight inclination, angling backward from the
    top to the bottom, to enhance ergonomic comfort. The edges of the rectangular
    prism should be smoothly rounded to create a cohesive style with the seat.
  name: Rectangular Backrest
- description: A set of rounded fillets applied to all four vertical edges of the
    rectangular backrest. The rounding should be subtle yet pronounced enough to soften
    the overall appearance of the backrest. The radius of the roundness should be
    consistent, matching the curvature style of the chair seat, ensuring a seamless
    transition between the two components.
  name: Rounded Edges
- description: A structural element that connects the backrest to the rear of the
    chair seat. This bracket should have a flat, rectangular shape with a slight taper
    toward the top to provide a secure attachment point. The bracket should be designed
    to fit snugly against the backrest and seat, allowing for a stable and sturdy
    connection. The edges of the bracket can also be rounded to maintain stylistic
    consistency with the backrest and seat.
