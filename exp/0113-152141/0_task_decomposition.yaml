- description: A tall, upright rectangular prism that serves as the main structure
    of the backrest. This component should be slightly taller than the chair seat,
    with a height that provides adequate support. The width should match the width
    of the chair seat, while the depth should be thinner to maintain a lightweight
    feel. The edges of the rectangular prism should be gently rounded to create a
    cohesive design that matches the style of the seat.
  name: Backrest Base
- description: A sloped surface integrated into the backrest base, angled backward
    to provide ergonomic support for the user's back. This incline should start from
    the top edge of the backrest base and smoothly transition down towards the seat.
    The angle should be subtle enough to offer comfort without being overly steep,
    creating a gentle recline.
  name: Ergonomic Incline
- description: A set of rounded edges applied to the corners of the backrest base
    and the incline. Each corner should have a consistent radius, effectively softening
    the harsh lines of the rectangular shape. This component not only enhances the
    aesthetic appeal but also improves safety by eliminating sharp corners, making
    it more comfortable for users.
  name: Rounded Edges
