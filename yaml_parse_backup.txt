issues: 
  - description: The tapered end appears too blunt and lacks the smooth tapering required for a wedge shape.
    suggestion: Adjust the vertex positions at the end of the shape to create a more pronounced taper and ensure a smoother transition in the geometry.
  - description: The overall dimensions of the wedge seem disproportionate, making it appear more cylindrical than wedge-shaped.
    suggestion: Re-evaluate the width and height ratio in the 3D model to better align with the intended wedge shape.
  - description: There are visible rough edges and faceting that could detract from the 'smooth' appearance specified in the description.
    suggestion: Increase the subdivision level in the mesh to achieve a smoother surface and reduce any visible edges.
consistency: false
